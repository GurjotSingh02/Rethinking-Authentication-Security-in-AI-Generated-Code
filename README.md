üìñ Abstract

Authentication is a cornerstone of secure software systems, but vulnerabilities often arise from improperly implemented source code. This project evaluates the security of authentication-related code generated by AI-driven tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based compliance testing and penetration testing, we explore vulnerabilities such as weak password management and insecure multi-factor authentication (MFA). This study highlights the potential for enhancing AI tools to generate robust, NIST-compliant authentication workflows.

üöÄ Research Goals

Evaluate Security Performance: Analyze AI-generated code for adherence to modern security standards like NIST and OWASP.
Enhance Prompt Engineering: Study how prompt specificity impacts the security of generated code.
Test RAG's Effectiveness: Use RAG to automate compliance checks against NIST guidelines.
Conduct Penetration Testing: Examine the resilience of AI-generated code to common attacks, including SQL injection and XSS.
üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. Tool Selection
We evaluated four AI-driven coding tools:

GitHub Copilot
Codeium
CodeWhisperer
ChatGPT
2. Prompt Engineering
Developed basic and advanced prompts to analyze AI's intrinsic security awareness:

Basic prompts focus on general functionality.
Advanced prompts emphasize "secure" code and adherence to "NIST Guidelines."
3. Compliance Testing with RAG
Automated the assessment of NIST SP 800-63B adherence using:

NotebookLM for guideline parsing.
ChatGPT-4 for evaluation and reporting.
4. Penetration Testing
Used OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities in generated code, including:

SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Token Hijacking
5. Comparative Analysis
Compared outputs to identify strengths and weaknesses, providing actionable recommendations.

üìä Results

Highlights
ChatGPT showed the most improvement in generating secure code when using advanced prompts.
Common Vulnerabilities Identified:
Insecure password management.
Weak MFA implementations using non-cryptographic randomness.
Lack of rate limiting, allowing brute-force attacks.
MFA Code Delivery Methods
Tool	Delivery Medium
GitHub Copilot	SMS (Twilio)
CodeWhisperer	SMS (Twilio)
Codeium	TOTP (PyOTP)
ChatGPT	Email (SMTP)
üî¨ Key Findings

Insecure Defaults: Tools rely heavily on default configurations, often not secure.
Cryptographic Choices: ChatGPT demonstrated the best practices by using Argon2, whereas others used weaker algorithms like Bcrypt or PBKDF2.
RAG Effectiveness: RAG effectively identifies guideline violations but struggles with nuanced security concepts like encryption vs. hashing.
